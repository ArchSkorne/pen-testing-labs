# Python Intermediate - Learning Path

## Phase 1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
**Goal**: Master classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation

### Topics to Cover:
- [ ] Classes and Objects
- [ ] Constructor (__init__) methods
- [ ] Instance vs Class attributes
- [ ] Methods vs Functions
- [ ] Inheritance
- [ ] Method overriding
- [ ] Polymorphism
- [ ] Encapsulation (private/protected)
- [ ] Properties and getters/setters
- [ ] Class methods and static methods
- [ ] Multiple inheritance
- [ ] Abstract classes

### Practice Projects:
1. **Student Management System** - Classes, inheritance
2. **Vehicle Hierarchy** - Polymorphism and inheritance
3. **Bank Account System** - Encapsulation and properties
4. **Security Tool Framework** - Abstract classes for pen-testing tools

## Phase 2: Data Structures & Collections
**Goal**: Work with complex data and file operations

### Topics to Cover:
- [ ] Lists (advanced operations)
- [ ] Dictionaries and sets
- [ ] Tuples and named tuples
- [ ] List comprehensions
- [ ] Dictionary comprehensions
- [ ] Generator expressions
- [ ] Collections module (Counter, defaultdict, etc.)
- [ ] Sorting and searching algorithms

### Practice Projects:
1. **Log File Analyzer** - Parse security logs
2. **Network Scanner Results** - Organize scan data
3. **Vulnerability Database** - Store and query CVE data
4. **Password Strength Checker** - Dictionary-based validation

## Phase 3: File I/O & Error Handling
**Goal**: Robust file operations and error management

### Topics to Cover:
- [ ] File reading and writing
- [ ] Working with CSV files
- [ ] JSON data handling
- [ ] Exception handling (try/except/finally)
- [ ] Custom exceptions
- [ ] Context managers (with statements)
- [ ] File paths and os module
- [ ] Regular expressions

### Practice Projects:
1. **Configuration File Manager** - JSON/YAML handling
2. **Report Generator** - CSV output for pen-test results
3. **Log Monitoring Tool** - Real-time file watching
4. **Data Backup Utility** - File operations with error handling

---

## Phase 4: Modules & Packages
**Goal**: Code organization and reusability

### Topics to Cover:
- [ ] Creating modules
- [ ] Package structure
- [ ] Import statements and __init__.py
- [ ] Standard library exploration
- [ ] Third-party packages (pip)
- [ ] Virtual environments
- [ ] Package distribution

### Practice Projects:
1. **Security Toolkit Package** - Organize your tools
2. **Network Utilities Library** - Reusable functions
3. **Reporting Framework** - Modular report generation
4. **Configuration Manager** - Settings and preferences

## Suggested Learning Order:
1. **Week 1-2**: OOP fundamentals (Classes, objects, inheritance)
2. **Week 3**: Data structures and comprehensions  
3. **Week 4**: File I/O and error handling
4. **Week 5**: Modules and packages
5. **Week 6**: Integration project combining all concepts

## Integration with Cybersecurity:
- Apply OOP to create security tool frameworks
- Use data structures for vulnerability management
- Implement file I/O for log analysis and reporting
- Build modular tools for your pen-testing toolkit
