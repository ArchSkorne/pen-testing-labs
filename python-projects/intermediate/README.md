# Getting Started with Intermediate Python

## 🚀 You're Ready to Begin!

I've set up a complete intermediate learning structure for you:

### 📁 Folder Structure Created:
- `01-oop/` - Object-Oriented Programming
- `02-data-structures/` - Advanced data handling  
- `03-file-io/` - File operations & error handling
- `04-modules/` - Code organization & packages

### 📋 Your Learning Roadmap:
1. **Start with `learning-roadmap.md`** - Complete overview
2. **Begin OOP lessons** - I've created your first 2 lessons
3. **Follow the 6-week progression** - Systematic skill building

### 🎯 First Steps:
1. **Run the first OOP lesson:**
   ```bash
   python3 intermediate/01-oop/01_classes_and_objects.py
   ```

2. **Complete the exercises** in each file

3. **Build on concepts** - Each lesson connects to cybersecurity

### 🔧 What Makes This Intermediate:
- **Real-world applications** - Security tools, not toy examples
- **Complex concepts** - Inheritance, polymorphism, error handling
- **Integration focus** - Building actual penetration testing utilities
- **Portfolio projects** - Code you can show employers

### 💡 Learning Tips:
- **Practice daily** - Even 30 minutes builds momentum
- **Code along** - Don't just read, type and experiment  
- **Connect concepts** - Link each lesson to your pen-testing goals
- **Ask questions** - I'm here to help explain anything unclear

### 🎮 Ready to Start?
Run that first lesson and see how classes can organize your security tools!

The jump from basics to intermediate is significant, but you have a solid foundation. Let's build some real cybersecurity tools! 🛡️
