The `security-tools/` folder in your Python projects would be perfect for cybersecurity-specific scripts and tools. Here are the types of projects you'd create there as you advance in your learning:

## Network Security Tools
- **Port scanners**: Custom Python implementations using `socket` library
- **Network discovery scripts**: ARP scanning, subnet enumeration
- **Protocol analyzers**: Packet capture and analysis tools
- **Vulnerability scanners**: Custom scripts to check for specific CVEs
- **Network monitoring**: Traffic analysis and anomaly detection

## Web Application Security
- **SQL injection testers**: Automated payload delivery and response analysis
- **Directory busters**: Web directory and file enumeration
- **Form fuzzers**: Input validation testing scripts
- **Cookie/session analyzers**: Authentication bypass tools
- **XSS detection scripts**: Cross-site scripting vulnerability finders

## System Security & Forensics
- **File integrity checkers**: Hash comparison and change detection
- **Log analyzers**: Security event parsing and correlation
- **Memory dumpers**: Process memory extraction tools
- **Registry analyzers**: Windows registry security assessment
- **Malware detectors**: Basic signature and behavior analysis

## Penetration Testing Utilities
- **Payload generators**: Custom shellcode and exploit creation
- **Post-exploitation tools**: Data exfiltration and persistence scripts
- **Privilege escalation checkers**: System weakness identification
- **Report generators**: Automated pentest documentation
- **Credential harvesters**: Password and hash collection tools

## Automation & Integration
- **API security testers**: REST/GraphQL vulnerability assessment
- **CI/CD security scanners**: Pipeline security validation
- **Cloud security auditors**: AWS/Azure configuration checkers
- **OSINT collectors**: Information gathering and reconnaissance
- **Threat intelligence feeds**: IOC collection and analysis

These would integrate perfectly with your pen-testing lab months, providing hands-on Python implementation of the concepts you're learning!
