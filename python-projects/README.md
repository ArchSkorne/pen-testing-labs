# Python Projects

This folder contains Python projects and exercises as I build foundational programming skills for cybersecurity work.

## Learning Path

### Current Courses
- **Mosh's 2-hour Python Full Course** - Basic fundamentals and syntax
- **FreeCodeCamp Python Course** - Comprehensive programming concepts

### Goals
- Build a solid Python foundation for cybersecurity automation
- Develop scripting skills for penetration testing tools
- Learn to create security-focused utilities and analysis scripts

## Project Organization

Projects are organized by learning stage and complexity:

```
python-projects/
├── basics/           # Fundamental exercises from Mosh's course
├── intermediate/     # More complex projects from FreeCodeCamp
├── security-tools/   # Cybersecurity-focused Python scripts
└── automation/       # Lab automation and utility scripts
```

## Python in Cybersecurity

Python is particularly valuable for:
- **Network scanning** and enumeration scripts
- **Web scraping** and reconnaissance automation
- **Log analysis** and incident response tools
- **Exploit development** and proof-of-concepts
- **Report generation** and data visualization
- **API interaction** with security platforms

## Project Ideas for Later

Once I have the basics down, potential cybersecurity projects:
- Port scanner using Python sockets
- Password strength analyzer
- Log file parser for security events
- Simple vulnerability scanner
- Automated reconnaissance script
- Security report generator
