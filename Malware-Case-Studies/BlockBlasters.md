🔍 STAR Story: Incident Response Framing
Situation: A free game on Steam was used to distribute malware targeting crypto holders. Task: Investigate the malware’s behavior, assess platform risk, and develop mitigation strategies. Action:
Analyzed update logs and malware behavior using sandbox tools
Traced C2 infrastructure and Telegram logs with OSINT techniques
Coordinated with VXUnderground and ZachXBT for attribution
Drafted GRC recommendations for platform vetting and user education Result:
Game delisted from Steam
Community raised $32,500 to support affected streamer
Security researchers linked the attack to a U.S.-based suspect
🛡️ GRC & SOC Analyst Takeaways
Risk Management: Steam’s “Verified” status failed to prevent malicious updates
Compliance Gaps: No mandatory code review for post-launch patches
User Awareness: Crypto holders were targeted via spearphishing (e.g., paid promo offers)
Incident Response: Community-driven threat intel was faster than platform response
Mitigation:
Enforce sandbox testing for game updates
Educate users on phishing tactics tied to gaming platforms
Monitor for unusual outbound traffic from gaming executables
🧪 Penetration Testing Angle
Lab Idea: Recreate the malware’s behavior in a safe VM using TryHackMe or custom GitHub repo
Focus Areas:
Credential harvesting
Wallet extension scanning
C2 communication
Tools: Wireshark, Procmon, Any.Run, Python scripts for wallet detection
