üê¥ Case Study: The First Trojan Horse ‚Äî The ANIMAL Program (1975)
Category: Malware History | Threat Intelligence | GRC | SOC Awareness Date: 1975 Source: CDC Cyber Systems | John Walker | Historical Malware Archives
üìå Executive Summary
The first known Trojan Horse malware was created in 1975 by programmer John Walker. It was disguised as a game called ANIMAL, which guessed the animal a user was thinking of. Hidden within the game was a companion program called PERVADE, which secretly copied itself to other directories on the system. Though not malicious by today‚Äôs standards, it pioneered the concept of deceptive software ‚Äî laying the groundwork for modern Trojans.
üß† Key Technical Details
Name: ANIMAL (game) + PERVADE (Trojan component)
Platform: CDC Cyber mainframe systems
Author: John Walker
Functionality:
ANIMAL: Interactive guessing game
PERVADE: Scanned directories and copied ANIMAL to accessible locations
Malware Type: Trojan Horse (non-destructive, self-replicating)
Impact: Spread across CDC systems, raising awareness of software trust and access control
Detection: Discovered by system administrators noticing unexpected file propagation
üîç STAR Story: GRC/SOC Framing
Situation: A seemingly harmless game was spreading across CDC systems without user consent. Task: Investigate the behavior, determine intent, and assess system vulnerabilities. Action:
Analyzed file propagation patterns
Identified hidden logic in the PERVADE module
Reviewed access control policies and user permissions
Drafted early guidelines for software trust and executable behavior Result:
Recognized as the first Trojan Horse malware
Sparked discussions on ethical programming and system hygiene
Influenced future security models for software distribution
üõ°Ô∏è GRC & SOC Analyst Takeaways
Trust Boundaries: Even non-malicious code can violate user expectations
Access Controls: Lack of directory permissions enabled silent replication
User Awareness: Early example of social engineering via entertainment software
Policy Evolution: Led to stricter controls on executable behavior and user consent
Mitigation:
Enforce least privilege access
Monitor for unauthorized file replication
Educate users on software provenance and trust indicators
üß™ Penetration Testing Angle
Lab Idea: Recreate ANIMAL‚Äôs behavior in a safe Python script
Focus Areas:
Directory scanning
File replication
Concealed logic within benign applications
Tools: Python, Bash, VirtualBox, GitHub repo for historical malware emulation
