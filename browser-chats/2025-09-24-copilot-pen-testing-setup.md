# Conversation
You pasted an HTML export of a Copilot chat titled "William Braly – Cybersecurity Transition Context." Key sections included Career Goals, Education & Certifications, Skills & Strengths, GitHub Repo Setup, Repo Structure, Copilot Support Needed, RPCC CSIT Program Evaluation, and Next Steps.

## Career Goals
- Transition from industrial operations into cybersecurity
- Target roles: Penetration Tester, SOC Analyst, GRC Analyst
- Build a portfolio that bridges real-world experience with cyber principles

## Education & Certifications
- High School Diploma, Welding Certification
- Currently pursuing: CompTIA Network+, Security+
- Future goals: CEH, OSCP, CISSP

## Skills & Strengths
- Risk management, compliance, safety mindset
- Team leadership and incident response
- Hands-on labs via TryHackMe, Hack The Box
- Document organization and STAR story crafting
- Workflow discipline and printable formatting

## GitHub Repo Setup
- Repo: `pen-testing-labs` (owner: ArchSkorne)
- Syncs between Windows and Linux using Git scripts
- Default terminal directory set to repo root

## Repo Structure
Organized by month (Month01..Month12). Each folder contains `lab-notes.md`, `nmap-results.txt`, `resources.md`.

## Copilot Support Needed
- Generate lab walkthroughs, STAR stories, technical writeups
- Suggest tools, resources, and exercises per topic
- Assist with Markdown formatting and printable layouts
- Guide best practices for documenting penetration testing labs

## RPCC CSIT Program Evaluation
Benefits: affordable, foundational certs
Limitations: not offensive-security focused

## Next Steps
- Document each month's labs in Markdown
- Use STAR stories to connect industrial experience to cyber scenarios
- Embed resource links and format for printing
- Build a professional portfolio with GitHub as the foundation

# Actions / To-dos
- [ ] Convert RPCC evaluation into a short note under `resources.md` or `copilot-context.md`
- [ ] Add preparatory Month0 tasks (environment setup, legal/safety notes) to `user-context.md` and Month01 templates
- [ ] Start Month01 `weekly-progress.md` with environment setup steps (install VirtualBox, snapshot VMs)

# Links
- `user-context.md`
- `templates/import-chat.ps1`
